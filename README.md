# python_journey
These codes are part of my journey learning python. They focuss on geospatial analysis and use the osmnx library. The tutorial paper is available [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00743/full).

The [Brisbane](./Brisbane.ipynb) python notebook deals with journey from Westin Hotel to surrounding building within 500 metres radius.
