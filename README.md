# python_journey
These codes are part of my journey learning python. 

The first part focusses on geospatial analysis and use the osmnx library. The tutorial paper is available [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00743/full). The [Brisbane](./Brisbane.ipynb) python notebook deals with journey from Westin Hotel to surrounding building within 500 metres radius. A second example uses codes provided from osmnx for examining street network orientation in Australian Capital Cities [![here](./AustCities.png)](./AustCities-Copy1.ipynb) 

The second part focusses on machine learning and uses sklearn. The random forest regression example is provided [here](./RFstandfirm.ipynb)

The third part focusses on manifold learning and uses sklearn manifold tsne. The T-distributed Stochastic Neigbor Emebdding example is provided [![here](./TSNEecr_sns.png)](./TSNEecr.ipynb). This is a low dimensional representation of the thrombectomy trial data. The file also contains illustration about merging pandas data frame and provides 3 types of plot: seaborn, matplotlib and plotnine-ggplot style.
